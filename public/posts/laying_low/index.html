today was a day I was laying very low. After a weekend of traveling, a day has come to just sleep, recover, and catch up at what happened these busy past few days.

      <p>Hello,</p>
<p>today was a day I was laying very low. After a weekend of traveling, a day has come to just sleep, recover, and catch up at what happened these busy past few days.</p>
<p>Before going to sleep soon I am reading some beautiful lines here in front of me, which I feel like sharing with you.</p>
<p><em>„Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.This means that whatever man sends out in the world or deed, will return to him; what he gives, he will receive.
If he gives hate, he will receive hate; if he gives love; he will receive love; if he gives criticism, he will receive criticism; if he lies he will be lied to; if he cheats he will be cheated. We are taught also, that the imaging faculty plays a leading part in the game of life.
Keep thy heart (or imagination) with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life“</em></p>
<p>Quoted from „The writings of Florence Scovel Shinn“.</p>
<p>I look back at my weekend. The years. My friends, my life. What have I created? What have I received? Most importantly, what did I give?</p>
<p>There are unbelievable amounts of gratitude which I can feel. So much joy. Thank you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel for the things that I gave which have created pain in the world. I am sorry. I was weak and stupid. I will do anything in my power to get strong and create more of the good. Because thats for what I am here.</p>
<p>To take ownership and responsibility for all that happens to me… heaven and hell.</p>
<p>To take ownership and responsibility for all that happens to me… I would choose no differently.</p>
