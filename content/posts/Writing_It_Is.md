For such a long time I contain that desire to write. It is living within me. Burning high. I have just read a piece from a year ago expressing that feeling so clearly. It was as if I wrote it just an hour ago. I remember so vividly, going my way through the woods, not far from home. I am coming closer and that feeling for writing is rising up. "Hi, here I am again!". What a moment of beauty and presence. What a beautiful moment of indulging in desire. 

Now I feel at home.
