Nah, today was pretty good. 

At a point I just sat there for like 30 minutes, breathing deep, feeling, and considering. Just being. Letting it flow. Was really beautiful. Bits of pain here and there, but itâ€™s needed, isn't it?

Being close to going to sleep now I look back at these hours. I even got a whole lotta shit done! A lot. Working towards these goals, so so so much. Everyday, putting in the work. 

The mind is clear.
