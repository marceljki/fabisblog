Reality is so… formable. 

Walking through days seeing infinite possible realities potentially unfolding…

which one do we choose?  
which one do you wish for?

Infinite numbers of ways to act… choosing accordingly to soul. 

Right or left? Up or down? Kind or angry? _Full or empty_?

To find those who are yours… 

Which we _choose_.
