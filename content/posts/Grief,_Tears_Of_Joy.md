How can it be so sweet and bitter at the same time? Sitting here, in grief, with tears of joy. 

I don't want to leave. I want to stay, the moment never passing. The weekend going on forever. 

Again, the manifestation of being in the right place, at the right time, with the right people. That feeling ofâ€¦ fullness, and connection. 

But I have to go. Waking up early in the morning.
