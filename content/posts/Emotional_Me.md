I donâ€™t know if Christmas did this to me, but somehow I am super emotional about my family and friends. 

I have spend a good evening with three of my closest friends in the living room. Fire was burning slow in the chimney. No music was on. Just we. The three of us. 

I consider this a pure blessing in life. I thank you, my friends. 

So emotional. What good can I do for you? Is it enough? 

You are deserving of the world and beyond. 

Sitting upstairs in my room. Hearing the laughter from down there. The laughter of you, soothing my soul.
