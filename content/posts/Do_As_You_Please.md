We all know that guy who is always tired. That guy who seems to love to sleep on the table in school. Even though he already had his 11 hours at night. 

I know the cause. 

When we do not create our lives by how we personally feel and think, we experience _a loss of energy._  We are a victim of circumstance. We get tired, bored, or even stressed. 

The cure for that is to proactively create the situation to how we desire it to be. With and through presence.

_Presence is the answer._

Creating reality requires strength. Independence. Self esteem. Values which I would love to see more of in this modern world. 

The good news is that we _can_ get our strength back, if we have lost it somehow. 

The answer is to live by our own inspiration (& imagination). And to build up our self esteem again. 

In all areas of my life (work, relationship, sport, art, etc.), I like to do things just the way I want them to be. I decide. I do as I please. (And that does not necessarily exclude a compromise!). 

That puts us in a state of energy, presence, fullness, confidence, and fun. 

I can hear people scream that we just cannot do as we please.

I tell you that we can. Otherwise, life is going to be a disaster. 

In the first place, who the fuck tells you what to do? And why do people believe they canâ€™t be doing what they truly desire? The system is coming for you. Watch out. 

I decide that my life is mine. I do as I please. I do what I think is best for me and the world. And I also want to see people strong and inspired building their life the way they wish it to be, day by day! 

Have a good one!
