God, I feel like I’ve been doing this forever already. Hah! Just a-nother piece (insert singing voice). I’m tired. Which is good. I had a good day. Fuck, it was great to be honest. I ate well, trained hard, connected with people, learned some new things, did what I am supposed to do. I kind of even „broke a record“. Our trainer told us that in many years only 3 people did a rope swing from one section to another, at a certain distance. I took the challenge and did it as well. I felt like I could go even further. Well, was fun. Thank you. 

Since the end of 2014 I am continuously writing "a diary". I got 5 smaller books filled already. Capturing my days, emotions, situations, thoughts, ideas, whatsoever. Mainly though it is about how I feel, what I think and what i am doing. Where I stand in life. Sometimes, maybe every couple months, I go back through some parts of them. Life never ceases to amaze me. In hindsight I see the way I took. Who I was. Who I’ve become. The areas in which I have grown. My problems, which have resolved or maybe did not.
