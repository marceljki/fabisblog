I close my eyes. I take a deep breath. I visit again. Here I am. At this special place. I don’t wanna write just like this. I am no academic. Maybe I am. Who even cares. I am someone close to me. To that thing. So close. 

Some call it the flow state. Some may even call it trance. Others, including me, like to describe it as full presence. It's that place where no thinking takes place, just the current. The art. The moment. Creation! That’s where i am coming from. That’s where I go. That’s where I am. 

I am no native english speaker. But that language became so dear to me. I apologize for errors. But is there some like that, I wonder? Language is like art, expressing. I came to the conclusion that self expression is so much life. Self expression feels good, is right, it may be even the core of being. So, through language, here I go. Poetically?

SELF EXPRESSION, I read in big letters right here on my desk. I wrote it down quite some time ago, in full conviction. And still, to this day, it's SO RIGHT. I mean, the good days are filled with self expression. All of them! Think about it. Those days, when you feel uninhibited, free, self confidently saying what you think, thats great! And I wish everybody could experience more of that, BECAUSE THATS WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE ARE HERE. To self express. Beings, that express themselves freely. I love it! I love to do it as much as I love to see it in others! 

The premise for self expression is self esteem. Only if we FEEL worth and appropriate to express ourselves as we are, we can live it. Self esteem might be the topic I studied most extensively in my life, for years, and hundreds of hours. What it is, where it comes from, what it does, how it works, and of course how to increase it. Self esteem is a topic I will dive very very deep into, and there might be a chunk of it in almost every post I publish. I feel like right now I could go on for hours, writing and writing… it’s that special place.
