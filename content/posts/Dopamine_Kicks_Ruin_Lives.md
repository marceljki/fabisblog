My theory is that the more artificial dopamine we consume, produce and exert… the more fucked up and unhappy we get. 

The more social media scrolling, smoking, drinking, porn, sugar, overeating, youtube videos, Netflix, thousand selfies, and so on, you name it… the more we burn out. The list can go on forever in this modern world.

I think there is nothing wrong with all these things itself. It is HOW we use it. 

Many many people are using all those things to numb themselves. To numb the pain. To get the next dopamine kick. And the next. And the next. Until we crash. 

I find that NONE of these things listed above REALLY make me happy. Sometimes they are fun. Until it's enough. No more interest. 

What I find which REALLY makes me happy is authentic self expression… which comes from within. I mean things like creativity, writing, drawing, connecting and spending time with people, working out, feeling my body, reading, going out into nature, just being… 

Some of that stuff it is for me. Most of the time I am actually doing things that are _meaningful_ to me. 

To me. Everybody is an individual. And you gotta figure out the stuff that _REALLY_ makes you happy and _fulfilled_ in life. 

Watch out for all these tiny little addictive dopamine kicks. They never fill us up. They are endless cravings. They ruin lives.
