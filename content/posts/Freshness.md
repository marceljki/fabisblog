The past couple days I have this feeling of freshness over me…

I see the world with _brand_ new eyes. 

My brand. 

I see infinite numbers of possible ways for reality to unfold right here and now… and, I got to choose. 

I have never felt it that intense before. 

I am on my way to unlocking imagination on a different kind of level again. Remember the days filled with rainbows? You were very, very young. 

It feels like I am getting back there again. 

These past few days I have been enjoying perfect absence of any kind of fear. I mean it. These days are up there with ones of the best of my life. And nothing spectacular even happened. It is within me. 

Can I create more of that I ask myself?

Even though my sight is clear… new questions arising on the horizon. 

Is it the endless flow of life? 

I appreciate.
